Almost every time, we get along really well and decide to be friends instead. ","I’d attribute my success to the girl I matched with being a friend of a friend, so we already kind of knew each other and the app was like the bridge finally bringing us together. I think the failures are because apps are so easy to just open and close, and not respond to, especially as a college student. I have a demanding major and am a student athlete, and that is usually the same demographic of my matches, so we’re always super busy and it’s hard to get things started. ","I’m strictly monogamous and a survivor of SA, so I’m very careful about who I hookup with. I prefer short term over one night stand, so I can make sure I like the person, and so it can come to more of a natural close rather than “okay I had a fun night” and then I’d see them still and only be able to think of that one night. Using a dating app was so important for my first WLW experience. I couldn’t out myself to all my friends yet or find anyone in my close community, so meeting someone on an app gave me freedom and choice. ","I’ve always been more chill with WLW situationships than het ones (I’m F/NB and Bi), and it’s nice that on apps, it’s easy to find people who are also a little nervous like I am, but want to get together and try it. That part is empowering to me - knowing I’m not alone, and then getting to see it through. I have heard stereotypes and stigmas discussed IRL about queer women and NB people, like that we’re all poly freaks and whatnot, and that hurts. However, that’s not something I hear often, and rarely ever within my close community, so maybe I’m just lucky to be geographically close to a liberal city. ","It is very important to me as a survivor of SA. When having sex with males, I always use a condom, and I am also on continuous birth control as a form of gender-affirming therapy that helps too. With other females, I don’t use physical forms of birth control. In general, I always talk to the person outside of sex topics first, and make sure I’d be able to say no if I had to, know where/when we’re hooking up, and have a friend watching my location.

","Feeling like I’m missing out on essential hookup/dating/sexual experiences during my core college years weighs on me a lot. Obviously my studies come first, but I waste a lot of time wishing for a relationship of some kind, or scrolling and talking to girls on dating apps. I think hooking up would relieve a lot of my stress, give me someone to feel close to, and raise my mood overall, allowing me to have more of a school-life balance and perform better in both aspects. ","Because of my disabilities that I have the ADA learning accommodations for, I spend significantly more time on my studies than my peers.
